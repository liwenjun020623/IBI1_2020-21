Question: 
How have new cases and total cases developed over time in Spain?

Line Number: From 51 to 61

Discussion:
The first case in Spain was confirmed in early March 2020.
Number of new cases starts to decrease from 2020-03-27. 
This suggests that after 2020-03-13 (considering infection was confirmed 14 days later), effective actions were taken to prevent the spread of the virus.
